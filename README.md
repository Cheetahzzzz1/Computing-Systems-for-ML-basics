# Computing-Systems-for-ML-basics

# Overview

This repository consists of Foundational implementations for computing systems in Machine Learning (ML). This notebook provides functions to compute essential statistical problems such as finding Mean and Standard Deviation for Multidimensional Data points.

# Requirements

To run the following Python notebook we need to install the following dependencies :-

        pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

# Problem Breakdown

<ins> Problem 1 : Mean Calculation</ins>

1. Function name : findMean(points)

2. Description : Computes the mean for each dimension of the dataset.

3. Implementation : Iterates over the dataset, sums values per dimension, and computes the average.

<ins> Problem 2 : Standard Deviation Calculation</ins>

1. Function Name : findStd(points)

2. Description : Computes the standard deviation for each dimension.

3. Implementation :
